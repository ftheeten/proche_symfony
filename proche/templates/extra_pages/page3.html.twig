Users of the database are warned that some records document research into people and cultures using scientific research models and language from the 19th and 20th centuries. These depicted people in ways that are outdated and offensive.

Users should also be aware that the database contains images of nakedness, ritual, or ceremonial activity that may not yet be classified as public, as well as staged settings, including those for scientific purposes. In some indigenous communities there may be prohibitions relating to the age, gender, initiation and ceremonial status or clan of the person who may see them. The database also contains the names of deceased persons, which may cause sadness or distress, particularly to relatives of these people.
